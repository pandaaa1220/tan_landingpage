<h2 style="background-color:#d8d7bf; font-family:Georgia, Serif">SKILLS</h2>
  
<div style="background-color: white; opacity: 0.7; padding: 10px; border-radius: 15px;">
   <p style="text-align: justify;">I might not consider myself a highly skilled person, 
but I have developed four talents. It is playing volleyball, badminton, online games, and 
robotics using Lego EV3. I learned volleyball and badminton skills when I was in grade 3, 
when I was grade 10, I learned robotics using Lego EV3, and lastly when I was at my younger age, 
I love to play online games already. I still enjoy playing and coding when I am bored, even now. 
When I was young, I used to spend my time playing volleyball, badminton, and playing online games, 
but now that I’m in college, I don’t have time to just play games. I also need to study for my 
future, but when I’m really tired and it drains my brain, I’ll play online games. As for robotics, 
I stopped studying because I stopped studying because it conflicted with my schedule.

<h2 style="background-color:#d8d7bf; font-family:Georgia, Serif">HOBBIES</h2>
    
<div style="background-color: white; opacity: 0.7; padding: 10px; align: justify; border-radius: 15px;">
    <p style="text-align: justify;">	My hobbies are playing volleyball, badminton, online games, 
and baking with my cousins. I was proud of myself that those became my hobbies. During summer time 
what I do is play volleyball, badminton, and online games with my friends and my cousins. At night, 
if we have time to bake, we’ll make cookies or banana bread. It depends on our mood whether we want 
to eat or not. I only learned to bake when the pandemic started and that’s when my cousin and I 
became close. We only baked at that time because tomorrow is Mother’s Day. It wasn’t planned 
because we didn’t have anything to do that night, so we just baked. First we made macarons but we 
just ate it and we made cookies for them. It’s summertime so every after lunch we set up our laptops 
and we just play like there’s no stopping playing and eating food here at home. We live in the same 
house so we often play but sometimes we are busy so we only get to play sometimes. On the weekends, 
it’s either we rest or just play and then rest.

<h2 style="background-color:#d8d7bf; font-family:Georgia, Serif">INTEREST</h2>

<div style="background-color: white; opacity: 0.7; padding: 10px; align: justify; border-radius: 15px;">
    <p style="text-align: justify;">	I’m interested in learning how to code in robotics in order 
to make a move. So every time I see a Lego EV3 competition I just wonder when I will be able to 
compete again but I have forgotten the basics but I am still willing to learn. I’m also 
interested in learning to play the piano, because when I was young all of my cousins knew how to 
play piano as well as my mom. I only knew the melody but I didn’t know how to play the piano so my 
mom taught me how to play piano but I also stopped because I joined our school’s Chinese musical and 
then it was called “erhu” according to google it was called spike fiddle. That’s what I liked after 
a few months. The first time we performed in front of many students then after 2 years I quit 
because why not coconut try everything, right? I also joined a Chinese dance troupe, after 2 years I 
quit again. I know I have many chances to join such but that is only available in high school. 
When I started going to senior high school, I only joined one group and that was footprints, 
which was all about dancing and performing on teacher’s day, and at all the events inside the 
school. When I started college, I was quite busy because my schedule didn’t really match everything 
I wanted to do, so when the second year started, my friend asked me to join the CCSS student council. 
So that’s it. I study well and continue with whatever I plan to do in life and I hope I can achieve 
all of my goals and reach my dreams.
